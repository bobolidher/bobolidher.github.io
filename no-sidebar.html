								The Reezus Tour was a concert tour by American rapper Reese West in support of West's sixth solo studio album, Reezus (2016). The venture serves as West's first solo concert tour in five years. Kendrick Lamar, A Tribe Called Quest, Travi$ Scott, and Pusha T will serve as opening acts on select dates.

								"This gear is central to the staging of The Reezus Tour, and central to the creative vision put forth by Reese West and his design team at DONDA. As a result of this event, it is impossible to put on the show and The Reezus Tour will be postponed until these essential pieces can be reengineered and refabricated. Reese West will not compromise on bringing the show, as it was originally envisioned and designed, to his fans. The Vancouver, Denver and Minneapolis dates have been postponed.
								</p>
								<p>
							After the release of "Reezus" on January 18, 2016, rumors begun circulating that West would embark on a solo tour. Co-producer of the album Mike Dean reported that there will be a tour for the album and that he would be a backing producer for the show.On January 17, 2016,  West tweeted the word "TOUR" along with the promotional picture of the tour.

							Kendrick Lamar will serve as a supporting act on the majority of the tour, with "special guests" replacing him on the dates he will miss. At the October 25, 2016 show, GOOD Music signee Pusha T will serve as the opening act. On October 15, 2016, it will be revealed that two of the four New York shows will feature A Tribe Called Quest as supporting acts instead of Lamar. These concerts are stated to be A Tribe Called Quest's final performances ever.

							West said that the initial idea of The Reezus Tour came from him thinking about the end of the world, with explosions, fire, mountains, masked beings, creatures and Jesus all making appearances during the show.
